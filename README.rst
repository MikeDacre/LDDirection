Get information about direction of agreement for any two lists of SNPs, based on https://github.com/CBIIT/nci-webtools-dceg-linkage

This basically just wraps the LDpair.py tool from that repository, all rights are maintained by the original developers.

To run this code, you will need a copy of a dbSNP sqlite database and a copy of all the 1000genomes VCF files.

**Note**: Currently under development and unstable/unusable.
